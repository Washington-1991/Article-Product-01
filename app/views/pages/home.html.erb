        <p>A dishwasher is a household appliance designed to clean dishes, utensils, and cookware efficiently and conveniently. It typically consists of a rectangular or square-shaped chamber with racks or baskets to hold dishes.

The process begins by loading dirty dishes into the dishwasher. Once loaded, the dishwasher fills with hot water, which is mixed with detergent to break down food particles and grease. Then, powerful jets spray the dishes from various angles, thoroughly cleaning them.
